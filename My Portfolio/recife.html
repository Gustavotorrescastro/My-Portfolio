            What is it about?
        </h2>
        <p>
            "Recife de Memórias" is a sensory interactive game that uses accessible technology to stimulate cognition and affection.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the city of bridges, Recife de Memórias is also a bridge between past and present — a way to reclaim identities, honor stories, and, above all, care with affection and technology.

        <h2>How does it Work?</h2>
        <p>
            The experience is based on a journey through the most iconic tourist spots in "Bairro do Recife", such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Marco Zero</li>
                <li>Cais do Sertão</li>
                <li>Parque das Esculturas</li>
                <li>Rua do Bom Jesus</li>
                <li>Forte do Brum</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Through a narration, the player must identify the location being described, find it on the map, and press the button of its corresponding color.
        </p>
        <p>
            After correctly identifying all 5 described points, the user must repeat the sequence of buttons pressed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The difference of Recife de Memórias lies in its humanized, intuitive, and culturally rooted nature. More than a game, it is a therapeutic tool
            that activates short- and long-term memories, stimulates attention, and promotes social interaction in an accessible and meaningful way.
