# Gustavo Torres Castro - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my [personal portfolio website](https://gustavotorrescastro.netlify.app/index_en). This project is a static web application designed to showcase my skills, projects, and academic background. It is built from the ground up using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, demonstrating a strong foundation in core web technologies.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **üåê Fully Bilingual**: Full content available in both English (EN) and Portuguese (PT).
* **üåó Light/Dark Theme**: A sleek theme switcher allows users to toggle between light and dark modes. The user's preference is persisted across sessions using `localStorage`.
* **üì± Fully Responsive Design**: The layout is built with modern CSS (Flexbox) to ensure a seamless experience across all devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
* **üìú Dynamic Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar becomes sticky and translucent on scroll for an improved user experience and cleaner look.
* **‚ú® Zero Dependencies**: Built purely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it lightweight, fast, and dependency-free.

| **HTML5** | Used for structuring the content with semantic tags like `<nav>`, `<main>`, and `<section>`.                                                                                                                       |

| **JavaScript (ES6+)** | Powers the site's interactivity: <br> ‚Ä¢ DOM manipulation for dynamic features. <br> ‚Ä¢ `localStorage` API for theme persistence. <br> ‚Ä¢ Browser API (`navigator.language`) for language detection. <br> ‚Ä¢ Event listeners for user interactions (clicks, scroll). |
| **Bootstrap Icons**| Used for clean, modern iconography throughout the application.                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Netlify** | Used for continuous deployment and hosting of the live site.                                                                                                                                                     |
