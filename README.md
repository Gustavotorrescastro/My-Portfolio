# My Portfolio

A [portfolio](https://tiny-croissant-84c217.netlify.app/) for you to get to know me a little better.
## Portfolio – Gustavo Torres Castro

Welcome to my personal portfolio repository! Here you will find three main HTML pages that present my information, certificates, and a project called Recife de Memórias. This README explains the project structure and the technologies used.

### Description

This portfolio was developed to display:

* **Home Page (`index.html`)**
    * “About Me” Section: Brief personal introduction, including age, education, and interests such as game development, software engineering, and Web3.
    * “My Certificates” Section: Link to a page (`certificados.html`) with Python and JavaScript certificates obtained from Cisco Networking Academy in partnership with CESAR School.
    * “My Projects” Section: Presents the "Recife de Memórias" project (with a link to `recife.html`) and the "CRUD of Animals" project (with a link to its GitHub repository).
    * “Contact” Section: Contact information, including email and LinkedIn.
    * "My GitHub" button that redirects to the GitHub profile.

* **Certificates (`certificados.html`)**
    * Displays certificates for the “Python Fundamentals 1” and “JavaScript Essentials 1” courses.
    * Each certificate is presented as an image.

* **Project: Recife de Memórias (`recife.html`)**
    * Detailed description of the “Recife de Memórias” project:
        * **What it is:** A sensory interactive game that uses accessible technology to stimulate cognition and affection, acting as a bridge between past and present to reclaim identities and honor stories.
        * **How it works:** Based on a journey through iconic tourist spots in Bairro do Recife (Marco Zero, Cais do Sertão, etc.), where the player identifies locations described in a narration and selects them on a map using colored buttons, having to repeat the sequence at the end.
        * **Key Feature:** A humanized, intuitive, and culturally rooted therapeutic tool that activates memories, stimulates attention, and promotes social interaction.
    * Links to the project's GitHub and website.

### Repository Structure

* `index.html`: Main portfolio page.
* `certificados.html`: Page displaying Python and JavaScript certificates.
* `recife.html`: Page dedicated to the Recife de Memórias project, with a detailed description and links.
* `style.css`: Global stylesheet that defines colors, fonts, and layout (using Flexbox).
* `Captura de tela 2025-06-02 010523.png` (referenced in `certificados.html`): Image of the Python certificate. (Note: the uploaded file is `.jpg` but the HTML references `.png`)
* `Captura de tela 2025-06-02 110231.png`: Image of the JavaScript certificate.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.

### Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
    * Use of tags like `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`, `<section>`, `<a>`, and `<button>` to structure content.
* **CSS3**
    * Styling of elements, colors, and fonts.
    * Layout built using `Flexbox` to organize elements on the pages.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)**
    * Basic DOM manipulation and click events for navigation between pages and for external links (e.g., buttons that redirect to specific URLs).
* **No external dependencies**
    * The portfolio was built using pure ("vanilla") HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, without the use of external frameworks or libraries.
